                    <p>As we grow up, our future may change from time to time, but we still do our best to graduate in CSTU.
                       Here’s just a few of career in computer science major that we want to do but, There’s more than that such as UX/UI career path such as UX/UI designer, information architect and more.
                       This all about creating user-centered designs for digital products, such as websites, mobile apps, and software interfaces.
                       Another path is cybersecurity career path who safeguards digital environments against a broad spectrum of threats such as security analyst, penetration tester, ethical hacker 
                       and more. Or another popular path in this time AI which involve mostly in machine learning and deep learning. They tend to analyze and developing AI to making a decision 
                       as a human. Here’s a few possibility jobs for instance Machine learning engineer (MLE), AI engineer and computer vision researcher. There’s more than that,
                       I hope that, This will inspires to you and help you to find your own path.</p>
