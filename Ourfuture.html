                        and more. Or another popular path in this time AI which involve mostly in machine learning and deep learning. They tend to analyze and developing AI to making a decision 
                        as a human. Here’s a few possibility jobs for instance Machine learning engineer (MLE), AI engineer and computer vision researcher. There’s more than that,
                        I hope that, This will inspires to you and help you to find your own path.</p>
