                    <p>
                        <br>Year 1 All in all, Iâ€™ll take time in adjusting to the university lifestyle and studying in addition to engaging in several various clubs and activities I want to experiment with. <br>
                        Year 2 From this year on, I shall begin engaging myself into my major by participating in events and even volunteer work to gain further experiences and skills. <br>
                        Year 3 This is my chance to intern and see how things work in the real world. I might also join exchange programs to explore more opportunities. <br>
                        Year 4 Complete a graduation project and prepare for a future career.
