                    <p>
                        <br>For the first year, It was a time to adapt to something i'd never experienced. Trying to discover new things, and enjoy my life. <br>
                        For sophomore, I think I would have to be a lot more serious about my life. Every subject would probably be a lot harder, so I will have to study harder. <br>
                        For junior, I would have to start to prepare myself for projects and jobs. Deciding which jobs I want to do. <br>
                        For senoir, I wish I could go intern somewhere. It would be the time I start to experience the work life. <br>
                        For 4 years, I wish I get more than C in every CS subjects, and going intern would be great for myself.
