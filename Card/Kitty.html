                    <h3>Chotika Pattanavijit</h3>
                    <p>
                        <br> In high school, I was interested in programming from attending camps at various universities. Since then, I chose to study in the Faculty of Science, Computer Science Program, at Thammasat University.
                        I entered the portfolio round. After entering, I participated in many activities, including playing music and freshman sports, which gave me more experience than just studying in the classroom.
                        I also practiced programming after studying in the classroom.
